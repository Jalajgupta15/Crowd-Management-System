# Crowd Management System

This is a demo Crowd Management System that demonstrates the use of various cutting-edge technologies to implement effective crowd management. The system is designed to handle large crowds, ensure safety, and optimize flow through real-time data processing.

## Features

- **Real-Time Crowd Monitoring**: Monitor crowd density and movement using sensors and data analytics.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzes crowd behavior and movements to improve future crowd management strategies.

## Files

- `CrowdManagement_(S).ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for the Small-scale Crowd Management demo.
- `Crowd_Management_(L).ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for the Large-scale Crowd Management demo.
- `data-s.csv`: Sample data for the small-scale crowd management system.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jalajgupta15/Crowd-Management-System.git
   ```

2. **Install necessary dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the required libraries installed, e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks**:
   - Open `CrowdManagement_(S).ipynb` or `Crowd_Management_(L).ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Execute the code cells step by step to see the crowd management system in action.
